## Overview

A comprehensive design system that provides a complete set of reusable UI components, design tokens, and guidelines for building consistent and accessible user interfaces. This project focuses on creating a scalable foundation that can be used across multiple products and teams.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Over 50+ pre-built components including buttons, forms, navigation, and data display elements.
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized design tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and other design values.
- **Accessibility**: All components built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and comprehensive keyboard navigation support.
- **Documentation**: Interactive documentation with usage examples, code snippets, and best practices.
- **Theme Support**: Multiple theme variants including light, dark, and high contrast modes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building interactive and reusable components.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Styled Components**: For component-based styling and theme management.
- **Storybook**: For component documentation and testing.
- **Jest & Testing Library**: For comprehensive component testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was ensuring consistency across all components while maintaining flexibility for different use cases. This required establishing clear design principles and creating a robust theming system. Additionally, maintaining accessibility standards across all components was crucial and required careful attention to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

## Outcome

The design system has been adopted by multiple teams and products, resulting in faster development cycles and more consistent user experiences. It has reduced design debt and improved collaboration between designers and developers.
